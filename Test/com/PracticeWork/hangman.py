hangman game

Sample XML Response: http://www.dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary.htm
Another option: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist

My original intention was to use dictionary's API to pull random words for my hangman
game. However, from digging in, that may not be a feasible option since I have to pass
the API a full URL will a 'word' in it. I was hoping to eliminate a list of words
that I store in my game. What I may do instead is create a list of words and make
an API call to grab the definition when the word is discovered (or not discovered also).

This is all to learn to work with URL's, API's, translating XML documents, and of
course the game itself.

Some features I'll mark off as I go (and remove from these comments):
display XXXXX for each letter and XXXXX XXX where necessary
allow user to guess the word
when a letter is guess correctly, reprint our message, ie. rxxr
Allow 6 turns (head, body, two arms, two legs)
