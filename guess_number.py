#===============================================================================
# Objective: create a random number guessing game that provides feedback, such
# as getting warmer or getting colder, until the user guesses the proper number.

#as long as debug_enabled is set to 'True' this section will process
if debug_enabled:

    print("Debug Mode Enabled: The random number is %s" % (random_num))

#===============================================================================
# This method is here to compare the user's guess to the randomly generated
# number. It determines the distance from the random number and prints
# different messages based on how close or far it is from the random number.

# 10 attempts to guess the random number. As long as it is within the 10
# attempts, try compare the numbers.
