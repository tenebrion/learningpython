# learningpython

Right now, this repository is dedicated to my learning Python and GitHub (version control).
I really have no other reason to be doing this other than I find it interesting and I'm learning new skills
in the process.

As I go through and learn new tricks, I go back and review old code to look for different ways I can streamline
the code. For example, courtesy of Reddit's learnpython sub-reddit, I found out that I shouldn't concatenate
lots of stuff with the print command. Instead, I should use {} and .format (although Codeacademy teaches something
different - print((%s : %s) % (stuff, more_stuff))). I also try to keep my code as close to PEP8 recommendations
to get into a habit.

Feel free to propose improvements, suggestions, comments, etc.! I love the prospects of learning more
efficient ways to code things (while maintaining readability).
