# learningpython

This repository will just be a compliation of simple learning scripts I've created. It is also helping me work with Github and Eclipse. I'll be curious to see what I think of these files over the years as I progress.

Sorry about the dive down test / com / practice to gain access to most of the work I'm currently doing. That is the structure Eclipse has and seems to keep that when connecting to Github.
