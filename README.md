# learningpython

Right now, this repository is dedicated to me learning Python and GitHub (version control).
I really have no other reason to be doing this other than I find it interesting and I'm learning new skills
in the process. I also realize that I wouldn't normally lump every file under a single 'tree' such as learningpython. This is just a quick and easy way for me to move from each learning project.

As I go through and learn new tricks, I go back and review old code to look for different ways I can streamline
the code. I also try to keep my code as close to PEP8 recommendations to get into a habit.

Feel free to propose improvements, suggestions, comments, etc.! I love the prospects of learning more
efficient ways to code things (while maintaining readability).
